This repository contains solutions of machine learning exercises from Coursera class, Machine learning by Andrew Ng: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/. I took the class a while ago, and I found the exercises are quite useful for basic understanding of machine learning, not relying on specific machine learning tool sets.

The course uses Octave, which is a great tool for quick scientific computing. Recently, I am test-driving Julia programming language for my possible future projects, and I decided to redo those exercises in Julia. I am new to Julia, and the whole effort is just for my practice. So, solutions in the repository are not sub-par or Julia idiomatic.

The problems and accompanying data in the repository are all from Courser class, Machine Learning by Andrew Ng: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome.  The license of those follows the original one. I do not have rights of the problems and the data.
